Hi! I'm **Kurorak**, and I like to make music for fun sometimes. I also play rhythm games often. My musics are all free to download (albums will be a name-your-price on Bandcamp, but you can still get them for $0), and they're mostly varied in genre.

Except for remixes and a select few, my works are under CC-BY 4.0 license:

You can contact me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Kurorak), Telegram (@kuror), or e-mail me at kurorak@outlook.com.

Hope to see you soon!
